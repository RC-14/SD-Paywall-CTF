# SD-Paywall-CTF

This repo is archived.
That doesn't mean that [StuDocu](https://studocu.com/) fixed anything.
The only thing that means is that (at the moment of archiving this repo) everything works as expected and there is no need to change anything ever again.

## Description

This is just a little ctf that was inspired by the paywall of [StuDocu](https://studocu.com/).
Their paywall is really easy to crack, but the ctf is a bit more difficult because you can't make any changes to the body (3 exceptions) and the position of the flag is randomized.

I did not report anything to [StuDocu](https://studocu.com/) because it's very obvious that this is possible and they probably get a report each day.

If you think this should be reported: Go ahead, maybe they'll fix it.

## How to play

### **1. Clone the repo**

```shell
git clone "https://github.com/RC-14/SD-Paywall-CTF.git"
```

### **2. Run the http server**

```shell
npm run start
```

I won't tell you how to install `node` or how  to use `cd`.
The internet exists.

Configuration is possible with these environment variables (obviously only numbers allowed):

- PORT: The port to listen on (default: 8080)
- FLAG_LENGTH: The length of the flag (default: 15). This is not the amount of characters, but the amount of random strings inside flag{}.
- FAKES: The amount of fake flags (default: 9).

### **3. Visit the website**

Something like `http://localhost:8080/`.
Just visit the website like any other website. (JavaScript is must be enabled - technically it's not but it's too easy if you disable it.)

### **4. Get the flag**

The flag looks something like this: `flag{random...string}`. (You'll instantly see if the flag is fake without even submitting it.)

There are multiple ways to get the flag:
<details>
<summary>Minor Spoilers (not the solution)</summary>
- CSS
- JS
</details>

### **5. Submit the flag**

Copy the flag into the text field and submit it. (Don't worry, about whitespaces, they're automatically removed by the submit button.)

If you are unable to copy the flag try disabling all extensions and reload the page.

### **6. You win!** (if you submitted the right flag)
